## Abstract

In the modern world that relies on data, the need for high-performance computing (HPC) resources has become more important for students and professionals dealing with computationally intensive tasks. Nevertheless, the steep prices linked with conventional cloud computing options create an obstacle for numerous users. In response to this challenge, we present Lend My Compute, a platform that allows users to rent and distribute compute resources, promoting a community-driven method for distributed computing.

## Target Customers and Use Cases


The primary customers can be divided into two distinct categories:


1. **Customer 1**: This group includes students, researchers, and professionals who require substantial computing power for tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, simulation, and rendering. These users often lack access to powerful hardware and are burdened by the high costs of traditional cloud services. "Lend my Compute" offers them a cost-effective alternative by allowing them to rent compute resources on-demand.

  

2. **Customer  2**: This group comprises individuals, educational institutions, and industries that possess underutilized, resource-rich computers. They can make their hardware available for sharing, effectively turning idle computing power into a source of income. This peer-to-peer network, resource providers can monetize their existing infrastructure while contributing to a broader computing ecosystem.

## Application Features and Capabilities

  
- **AI-Based Resource Allocation:** This application uses artificial intelligence to match resource requests with available hardware, making the allocation process based on factors such as availability, resource type, and user demand. This can ensure users receive the resources required for their specific tasks, minimizing wait times and maximizing efficiency.
    

- **Dynamic Resource Sharing Interface:** Users can easily browse available resources, select the desired compute power, and configure virtual machines (VMs) based on their needs. The interface provides real-time information on resource availability, pricing, and performance metrics supporting the users.
    
- **Security and Privacy:** To protect both resource providers and sharers, we create isolated Linux virtual machines (VMs) for each user session. These VMs are securely sandboxed, preventing interference with the host machine's files or processes. The application also implements encryption and access control measures to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality.
    
- **Cost-Effective Resource Access**: By using a decentralized network of resource providers we can significantly reduce the cost of accessing computing resources. This would make it accessible to a wider audience, including students and small businesses with limited budgets.
    
- **Income Generation for Providers:** Resource providers are paid based on the amount of computing power they contribute to the network. The payment structure is designed to support participation while ensuring a fair distribution of profits between the platform and the providers.
    

  
## Technical Implementation 

  

- **Virtualization and Containerization**: Using virtualization technologies like KVM and Docker to establish isolated environments for users. These technologies allow for effective distribution and control of resources, allowing numerous users to utilize a single physical machine without loosing speed or safety.
    
- **Resource Types**: Providing a variety of computing resources, such as CPU, GPU, and memory options. Users can ask for different kinds of resources depending on their needs, like multi core CPUs for parallel processing or strong GPUs for tasks in machine learning and deep learning.
      
- **Resource Pooling and Management**: A centralized resource management system that tracks the availability and status of all shared resources. This system allocates resources to users based on demand, ensuring optimal utilization of available hardware.
    

- **User-Friendly Interface:** A user-friendly interface that guides users through the of steps of requesting, configuring, and managing compute resources. The interface also provides usage statistics, billing information, and support resources.
    


- **Security and Compliance:** The platform enforces security measures to safeguard user data and follow the industry benchmarks. This involves implementing end-to-end encryption, utilizing multi-factor authentication, and checking for vulnerabilities.
